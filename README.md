## Instructions

Each card has a symbol on it that matches one other card on the board. The objective of the game is
to find the matching card to each pair in the least amount of moves and time possible.
If two cards do not match, they will shake, turn red, and flip back over. If they do match,
they will turn turquoise and a wiggle-like animation will play. Once all the card pairs are
uncovered, the game is finished and a congratulatory modal will be displayed with the final
game stats and a play again button.
